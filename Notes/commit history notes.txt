Notes to improve m commit history:
Here’s what might look good from an outsider’s perspective:

1. **Commit Granularity**: If possible, break down changes into smaller, focused commits (e.g., one for redirect updates, another for favicon changes). This allows anyone reviewing to see each step and makes it easier to identify what caused the crash.

2. **Troubleshooting Notes**: Once you've fixed the issue, you could add troubleshooting notes in the commit messages or in a README section. This demonstrates your attention to debugging and resilience in problem-solving.

3. **Version Control Strategy**: Mention that you reverted to a previous stable version or checked dependencies if the crash occurred due to an external issue. This shows your understanding of version control and debugging techniques.

4. **Future Improvements**: After resolving this, consider adding a comment explaining how you tested the changes to ensure stability. Recruiters and coders will see that you're proactive about avoiding future issues.

This approach highlights not only your coding skills but also your professionalism in handling setbacks. Let me know if you need help troubleshooting or organizing these improvements!
